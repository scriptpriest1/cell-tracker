**Critical Issue:**  
- In the **church admin's report page**, the report form for type `'outreach'` is incorrectly using the same structure as for `'meeting'`.  

**Requirement:**  
- For `'outreach'` reports:  
  1. **Attendance** and **New Converts** should be simple **input elements** just like it is for the **cell admin's page**, not dropdowns.  
  2. The **Outreach Kind** field must also be rendered.  
  3. This structure of the form should **match exactly** how it is implemented in the **cell admin's page**.  

**Guide:**
- Read the load_dynamic_content.php file to understand how the forms are currently being generated in the **cell admin's page**. The logic for rendering the forms begins around line 914.
- Use this as a reference to replicate the correct structure for the **church admin's outreach report form**.

**Task:**  
- Correctly implement the outreach form structure for church admins.  
- Ensure this change does not affect the `'meeting'` form type or any other unrelated logic.  
- Keep the implementation consistent with the cell admin's outreach form.  
- WORK ONLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS PROMPT
- DON'T ALTER THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE OF THE CELL ADMIN'S REPORT FORMS
