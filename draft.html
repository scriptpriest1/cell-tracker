**Feature: Church Reports Page**  

**Requirements:**  
1. **View reports of all cells under a church**  
   - In `church-reports.php`, there is a `<select>` element.  
   - Populate this `<select>` dynamically with the names of all cells in the church as `<option>` values.  

2. **Appending reports**  
   - When a cell is selected, append that cell’s `.reports-section` (same format as in `cells-reports.php`) into the `.cells-reports` element inside `church-reports.php`.  

3. **Church admin permissions**  
   - The church admin can **only view** reports of the selected cell.  
   - **Publishing and editing** are **not allowed** for church admins.  

4. **Published reports**  
   - Church admin can open/view the report (the "View" button should be visible and functional).  
   - The "Edit report" button should **not** be displayed.  
   - All fields inside the report form should always be **disabled**, regardless of the report’s status.  
   - For outreach reports: dropdown buttons should remain enabled, but the checkboxes inside them should be disabled.  

5. **Pending reports**  
   - Church admin should **not be able to open pending reports**.  
   - The "Publish" button should not be rendered at all.  
   - Publishing functions should not be applicable.  

6. **General restriction**  
   - All functions for publishing and editing **cell** reports should not be applicable for church admins.  

**Task:**  
- Read the `church-reports.php` file first to understand the structure of the church reports section that already exists.  
- Place/append the new functionality in the correct parts of this file accordingly.  

**Possible files to modify:**  
- `church-reports.php` (may not require much or any modification at all)  
- `cells-reports.php` (for reference on the report format. May also not require modification)
- `ajax.php`
- `ajax.js`
